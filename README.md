Welcome to my microservices bank demonstration!  
It consists of 3 microservices and a connective gateway  
Run each of them separately by CDing them and running 'npm start'  
To fill your DB with mock data, go into the user microservice and run 'npm run seed'  
Make sure your local mongo server runs on port 27017 and route your requests to the gateway port @ 8080  
Have fun! :)
